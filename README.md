# batterynagger
A Python based Noisy Nagger that lets you know when your laptop battery has reached user configured levels.

## Reason
As a programmer I tend to ignore the Linux/Windows "warnings" that my battery is at the lower end of the spectrum 
and requires a charge.  

This tends to happen at exactly the worst time possible and I have even lost some work because of it.  Also, the system builtin
warning get hidden by things like a movie player or screen saver.  Too many times, the screen saver comes up, and I am not 
looking at the screen and again hit the battery zero issue. 

## Solution

I hate to say it, but a constant audible ping is my solution (yes, just like a UPS).  
It annoys me enough to force me to do something now! 

Hence this program, enjoy!
