# Battery Nagger

A Python/Tkinter based Noisy Nagger that lets you know when your laptop battery has reached user configured levels, i.e. 30% a ping every once in a while, 20% a ping more frequently, and 10% constant ping every second!

## Background

As a programmer, I tend to ignore the Linux/Windows “warnings” that my battery is at the lower end of the spectrum and requires a charge.  

This tends to happen at exactly the worst time possible and I have even lost some work because of it.
Also, the system builtin warning get hidden by things like a movie player or screen saver.
Too many times, the screen saver comes up, and I am not looking at the screen and again hit the battery zero issue.

## Solution

I hate to say it, but a constant audible ping is my solution (yes, just like a UPS).  
It annoys me enough to force me to do something now!

Hence, this program, enjoy!

## Features

* User configurable levels: Warning, Critical, Fatal
* User configurable Ping Intervals for each: Warning, Critical, Fatal
* Runable from startup or script
* When critical has been reached, the app comes up and can't be minimized
